# App Requirements and Goals
The goal of my weight management app was to provide users with a simple and effective way to track their weight progress over time. The primary needs it addressed were organization and motivation. Many individuals want to monitor their weight but struggle with consistency or find tracking tools too complicated. This app was designed to offer a straightforward solution, allowing users to easily enter, store, and review their weight data. The overall requirement was to create a clean, functional, and user-friendly mobile experience that encourages consistent tracking without overwhelming the user.
# Screens, Features, and User-Centered UI
To meet user needs, the app features a main dashboard for viewing recorded weights, an input screen for adding new entries, and database functionality to store and retrieve data. Key features include adding, viewing, and managing weight entries in an organized format. My UI design emphasized clarity and simplicity, utilizing clear labels, logical navigation, and minimal clutter. I prioritized easy-to-read text, intuitive button placement, and a clean layout to enable users to complete tasks quickly. The design proved successful by reducing unnecessary steps and making the primary function—tracking weight—efficient and straightforward.
# Coding Approach and Strategies
While coding the app, I divided the project into smaller components, including UI layout design, database integration, and input validation. I focused on organizing my code clearly and implemented one feature at a time before moving on to the next. I adopted an incremental development approach and conducted frequent testing to ensure that each function worked properly. By separating concerns—keeping database logic distinct from UI logic—I was able to maintain structure and readability. These strategies can be applied to future projects to enhance scalability, maintainability, and overall code quality.
# Testing and Functionality
To ensure the code was functional, I conducted frequent tests on the app throughout the development process instead of waiting until the end. I verified that data was saved, retrieved, and displayed correctly, and I also tested various user input scenarios to prevent crashes and invalid entries. This testing process is crucial as it helps identify issues early, reduces the likelihood of larger errors later, and enhances user reliability. During testing, I discovered minor issues related to data handling and navigation flow, which I was able to correct before finalizing the app.To ensure the code was functional, I tested the app frequently throughout development rather than waiting until the end.

# Innovation and Problem-Solving
During development, I had to explore innovative solutions for database management and ensuring that data persisted correctly between sessions. Initially, I faced challenges with data retrieval and display, which required me to troubleshoot and restructure some of my logic. I revised my approach by carefully reviewing the lifecycle behavior and refining the way data was updated on the screen. This experience deepened my understanding of how backend components interact with the user interface.
# Demonstration of Knowledge and Skills
I was especially successful in implementing the database functionality and connecting it seamlessly to the user interface. This experience demonstrated my ability to manage data storage, accurately retrieve information, and present it clearly to users. It highlighted my understanding of structured development and user-centered design, as well as the importance of integrating functionality with usability to create a polished and practical application.
